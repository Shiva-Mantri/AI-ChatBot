# AI/Deep Learning Chat Bot
Everything about AI/Deep Learning ChatBot - Research, Code and Samples

## Introduction
Start with this course - [Deep Learning and NLP A-Zâ„¢: How to create a ChatBot](https://www.udemy.com/share/101X0W/). This course expects you to know Python and basics of Deep Learning programming. I know Python, however not much of AI/Deep Learning programming. So, after the data cleaning portion in course, I got totally lost in AI/Deep Learning part. The purpose of this github repo is to document my learning process. Following is not in specific order, but by the end of it, I should be expert in ChatBots, be able to determine whether to build, use COTS (commercial off the shelf) or FOSS (Free and Open Source) ChatBot. Lets Begin..
